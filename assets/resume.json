He demonstrated a proclivity for obsessive perfectionism early in his childhood by being a video game completionist.  At 11, he built his first computer and his first website (a fansite dedicated to Dragonball Z). At 15, he was selected to be a teacher's assistant, often teaching students in grades higher than his own. He does not believe in 'specialization', per say, and prefers to see connections that span all disciplines which reflects strongly in his work. Although entering NYU with 44 credits from the 9 AP's he took in H.S., he ended up with over 200 credits as he double majored in Biochemistry and Physics (the hard science trifecta) as well as electives in subjects disparate as Gender Studies to Argumentation and Debate. \n","location":{"address":"289 Harman 3L","postalCode":"NY 11237","city":"Brooklyn","countryCode":"US","region":"New York"},"profiles":[{"network":"Twitter","username":"RHendricksCEO","url":""},{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"Richard Hendricks","url":""}]},"work":[{"company":"Pretty Positron","position":"CEO/President","website":"https://prettypositron.com","startDate":"2013","endDate":"","summary":"Pretty Positron is a private management consulting firm for both Healthcare and Education based on a proprietary universal data analysis algorithm that has consistently fielded results that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical limit of project managment optimization in dynamic environments.\n","highlights":["Build an algorithm for artist to detect if their music was violating copy right infringement laws","Successfully won Techcrunch Disrupt","Optimized an algorithm that holds the current world record for Weisman Scores"]}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"CoderDojo","position":"Teacher","website":"https://coderdojo.com/","startDate":"2012-01-01","endDate":"2013-01-01","summary":"Global movement of free coding clubs for young people.","highlights":["Awarded 'Teacher of the Month'"]}],"education":[{"institution":"New York University - College of Arts and Science","area":"Biochemistry and Physics","studyType":"B.S.","startDate":"2006","endDate":"2010","gpa":"3.77","awards":["Magna Cum Laude","Phi Beta Kappa","CAS Scholars"]}],"awards":[{"title":"Digital Compression Pioneer Award","date":"2014-11-01","awarder":"Techcrunch","summary":"There is no spoon."}],"publications":[{"name":"Video compression for 3d media","publisher":"Hooli","releaseDate":"2014-10-01","website":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)","summary":"Innovative middle-out compression algorithm that changes the way we store data."}],"skills":[{"name":"Web Development","level":"Master","keywords":["HTML","CSS","Javascript"]},{"name":"Compression","level":"Master","keywords":["Mpeg","MP4","GIF"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker"}],"interests":[{"name":"Wildlife","keywords":["Ferrets","Unicorns"]}],"references":[{"name":"Erlich Bachman","reference":"It is my pleasure to recommend Richard, his performance working as a consultant for Main St. Company proved that he will be a valuable addition to any company.\n"}]}
